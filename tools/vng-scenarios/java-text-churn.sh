# #137 step 5 -- size the tier-1 one-pixel readback. The reporter's probe
# paints its text once, which proves the fix but measures nothing. This runs
# JavaTextChurn, which repaints 32 strings in fresh colours every 10ms so
# Java2D cannot reuse a source picture: every string is a CompositeGlyphs
# with its own XRSolidSrcPict, i.e. the worst case for a per-draw readback.
#
# Run with --env YSERVER_LOOP_TELEMETRY=1 and read the per-second rollups:
#
#   grep 'loop telemetry' yserver.log   # get_image_by_site/s[... glyphsrc=N]
#
# glyphsrc/s is the readback rate. Its COUNT is hardware-independent (one per
# admitted CompositeGlyphs); its COST is not, so a cache decision still needs
# a real GPU.
