# Sourced by tools/vng-shot.sh INSIDE the guest, with DISPLAY=:7 exported and
# the artifact directory as cwd. Issue #150 — does XkbGetMap()/
# XkbGetUpdatedMap() leave xkb->server->behaviors NULL, the way barrierc
# needs it not to be (see tools/xkb-behaviors-probe.c for the full story)?
#
# Deliberately runs NO window manager, no xterm, nothing else that could
# touch the keymap: this is a pure protocol probe and anything else running
# is a confound, not cover. `--dump none` is right — no rendering is
# involved, and the load-bearing artifact is probe.log plus probe.exit.
#
#   tools/vng-shot.sh --dump none --name xkb-behaviors-ys \

#       --scenario tools/vng-scenarios/xkb-behaviors-probe.sh
# NOTE: this file is sourced into vng-shot.sh's guest.sh, which runs under
# `set -eu`. The probe's whole point is to exit nonzero (2) when behaviors[]
# would segfault, so its invocation MUST be shielded from -e (a plain failing
# statement here would abort the guest script before READY is ever touched,
# which is exactly what happened during development of this scenario).
