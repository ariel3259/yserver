#
# Issue #137 (kaaduu): Java AWT/Swing text is invisible, and
# `-Dsun.java2d.xrender=false` cures it. Java2D's XRender pipeline paints
# every glyph through `XRSolidSrcPict` — a 1x1 pixmap picture with
# `repeat=Normal` — and the glyph path accepted only SolidFill and Gradient
# sources, so every text draw was discarded.
#
# No window manager on purpose. The probe is a single Swing toplevel that
# centres itself, and a WM would add its own text (titlebar, panel) to the
# scanout — which is cairo/pango text through CreateSolidFill, i.e. the path
# that always worked. Keeping the screen to just the probe means anything
# non-background in the dump came from Java.
#
# YS_XRENDER selects the pipeline, and is the whole experiment: `true` is the
# broken-before/fixed-after case, `false` is the in-run control that must look
# the same either way (it takes the core-X11 text path, which this change does
# not touch). Run it both ways and compare.

# kaaduu's probe, compiled to a gitignored directory (gist

# host's build is right there.

# YS_JAVA_AA picks the text antialiasing, which selects the GLYPH format and
# is a second, independent axis from the source-picture kind that #137 is
# about. `gasp`/`on` give grayscale AA and Java uploads A8 glyphs; `lcd` gives
# subpixel AA and Java uploads ARGB32 component-alpha glyphs, which
# `render_composite_glyphs` reduces to their alpha channel alone. There is no
# settings daemon in this guest, so the desktop default here is NOT what a
# MATE/GNOME session gives you -- forcing it is the only way to reach the LCD
# path from a bare guest.

# The JVM sometimes dies with SIGILL in C1-compiled code in this guest

# nothing to do with the X server. It has to be retried rather than tolerated:
# a run whose probe never mapped leaves a bare backdrop, and on the PRE-FIX
# side of an A/B that is easy to misread as "the bug". The window-mapped
# marker below is what separates the two.
