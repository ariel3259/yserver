# Sourced by tools/vng-shot.sh INSIDE the guest, with DISPLAY=:7 exported and
# the artifact directory as cwd. Tiled window borders (CWBorderPixmap) — the
# path the awesome smoke provably cannot reach (#133).
#
# Deliberately runs NO window manager: the client's windows are
# override-redirect, so nothing repositions or reparents them and every ring
# pixel has a predictable absolute coordinate. Works unchanged on yserver and
# on Xorg (`--server xorg`), which makes it a parity check as well.
#
# Check the capture with:
#     tools/border-pixmap-check.py <scanout.ppm>
