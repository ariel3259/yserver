# was never seen on a working desktop. The stock config paints a wallpaper
# across every screen, so the root is the drawable that straddles both outputs.

# Then sweep the cursor: on a dual-head layout the cursor is the only thing
# generating damage, so whatever it repaints marks exactly what was stale.

# ways that matter here: `beautiful.wallpaper` is a JPEG and
# `gears.wallpaper.maximized(wallpaper, s, true)` is called PER SCREEN, so a
# dual-head start paints the shared root-sized pixmap twice, once per screen,
# clearing the root each time. That is a very different damage sequence from
# one straddling paint. YS_RC overrides.
