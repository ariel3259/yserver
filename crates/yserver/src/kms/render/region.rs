//! Y-X banded region with real geometric set algebra.
//!
//! Step 0 of
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-01-damage-derived-scene-repaint-plan.md`.
//!
//! # Why this exists alongside `RegionSet`
//!
//! [`super::store::RegionSet`] is a `Vec<Rect2D>` whose `subtract` removes
//! **exact rect matches** as a multiset. That is deliberate and correct where it
//! is used: on the drawable snapshot/ack path an identical damage rect can
//! legitimately arrive twice while the first snapshot is in flight, and
//! geometric subtraction would drop the newer one.
//!
//! It cannot express the per-BO damage bookkeeping, which needs
//! `missing[bo] -= painted` — geometric subtraction of one region from another.
//! Used there, exact-match subtract would match nothing, `missing` would grow to
//! its rect cap, collapse to extents, and pin every frame to a full repaint for
//! ever: safe, silent, and useless.
//!
//! So both types exist, with a clean split: `RegionSet` for presentation damage,
//! `Region` for the scene and per-BO damage state.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! A canonical y-x banded list of half-open boxes, held to three invariants:
//!
//! 1. sorted by `(y0, x0)`;
//! 2. boxes are pairwise disjoint, and within one band (identical `y0`/`y1`) no
//!    two boxes touch — `a.x1 < b.x0` strictly;
//! 3. two vertically adjacent bands never carry an identical x-span list, so
//!    such bands are merged into one.
//!
//! Canonical form makes [`Region::area`] a plain sum (boxes are disjoint) and
//! makes equality of two regions equality of their box lists.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! Set operations decompose on y rather than merging bands incrementally the way
//! pixman does. For a binary op the distinct y edges of both operands are
//! collected, and in each resulting y-slice the operands' x-spans are combined
//! with a 1-D interval op; adjacent slices with identical spans are then merged.
//!
//! That is `O(n·m)` in box counts against pixman's `O(n+m)`, which is the right
//! trade at this size: [`Region::MAX_RECTS`] is 32, the operands are damage
//! regions of a handful of boxes, and 1-D interval algebra is far easier to get
//! right — and to test exhaustively — than incremental band merging. The cost is
//! bounded and constant; a correctness bug here is indistinguishable from a
//! damage bug on screen.
//!
//! # Partially wired
//!
//! Step 3 is the first consumer — `scanout_damage.rs` and the tick's damage
//! feed. The clipping and occlusion operations land with steps 4 and 1, so some
//! items are still dead outside the tests.
//! `expect` rather than `allow`, so this annotation itself starts warning the
//! moment step 3 wires the module up and must be removed. Gated on `not(test)`
//! because the tests below do exercise every item, so the lint fires only in a
//! non-test build and an ungated `expect` would be unfulfilled under
//! `--all-targets`.
